# Sample Spring REST client
Taken from here https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/

## Run like this:
./mvnw spring-boot:run

Alternatively, you can build the JAR file with ./mvnw clean package and then run the JAR file, as follows:

java -jar target/gs-rest-client-0.1.0.jar

## Test like this:
When the app starts up the endpoint in the GsRestClientApplication should get called. You will see the output of this in the logs.
