# Running a Spring Boot app as a Docker container

1. Build the app (so that a jar file is created in the target directory): ./mvnw clean package
2. Run this to build the docker image: docker build -t richtest/gs-spring-boot-docker . (you need the dot on the end here)
3. Run this to run the app: docker run -p 8080:8080 richtest/gs-spring-boot-docker 
4. Go to http://localhost:8080

##Â An alternative way to build the image:
This does the mvn package step and the build image step:
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=richtest/gs-spring-boot-docker

Then you can run as normal:
docker run -p 8080:8080 richtest/gs-spring-boot-docker

## Useful docker commands
(taken from https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker/)

To get a shell into the image:
```text
$ docker run -ti --entrypoint /bin/sh myorg/myapp
/ # ls
app.jar  dev      home     media    proc     run      srv      tmp      var
bin      etc      lib      mnt      root     sbin     sys      usr
/ #
```

If you have a running container:
```text
$ docker run --firstName myapp -ti --entrypoint /bin/sh myorg/myapp
$ docker exec -ti myapp /bin/sh
/ #
```

##  Notes
It would be better to use a multi-stage build in the Dockerfile - this performs the maven steps as well as the docker build
so that you only need to run one command. See here for more info: https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker/
